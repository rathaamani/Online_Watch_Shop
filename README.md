# Watch_shop
Description:

This is a fully functional online watch store website built using a combination of essential web development technologies:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive elements)
Back-end: PHP (for server-side scripting)
Database: MySQL (for storing product data, user accounts, and potentially orders)
The website allows users to browse through different watch categories, view individual product details, add items to their cart, place orders (simulated payment process), and view a dummy payment confirmation page.

Features:

Product Catalog: Browse through a categorized collection of watches.
Product Details: View detailed information about each watch, including images, descriptions, and potentially prices (if implemented).
Shopping Cart: Add and remove items from the shopping cart for purchase.
Order Placement: Simulate the order placement process with a dummy payment page (without actual payment processing integration).
User Accounts (Optional): Implement user accounts to allow user registration, login, and order history management (consider incorporating these features later).
Installation:

Database Setup:
Create a MySQL database and user with appropriate access privileges.
Import a sample database schema (if provided, adjust table structures and data as needed) or create one yourself to store watch data (product names, descriptions, images, prices, etc.).
Server-Side Configuration:
Configure your PHP environment with a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
Ensure appropriate permissions are set for accessing database connections and file paths.
File Structure:
Organize your website's files and folders in a clear and maintainable structure (e.g., separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, images, database configuration).
Usage:

Access your website's main page (index.html) in a web browser.
Navigate through watch categories.
Click on individual watches to view details.
Use the shopping cart functionality to add and remove items.
Simulate the order placement process through the dummy payment page.
